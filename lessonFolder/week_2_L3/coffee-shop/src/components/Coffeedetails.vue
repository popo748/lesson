                    The coffee plant is a bush or smalltree that grows in a belt
                    around the world along the Equator. There are twomain
                    commercially grown species of coffee beans:

                    <strong>Arabica:</strong> Grows best at high altitudes and
                    produces a mild,aromatic coffee. It accounts for about 70%
                    of the world's coffee pproduction.

                    <strong>Robusta:</strong> Can be cultivated at lower
                    altitudes and has a stronger, harsher taste with about twice
                    as much caffeine as Arabica. It's often used in espresso
                    blends and instant coffee

                    1. <strong>Picking:</strong> Ripe coffee cherries are
                    harvested by hand or machine.<br />
                    2. <strong>Processing:</strong> The fruit covering the beans
                    is removed, either by the dry method or the wet method.
                    <br />3. <strong>Drying:</strong> The beans are dried to
                    about 11% moisture content. <br />4.
                    <strong>Picking:</strong> The dried beans are hulled,
                    polished, graded, and sorted. <br />5. <b>Exporting:</b> The
                    raw beans are loaded into shipping containers and exported.
                    <br />6. <b>Roasting:</b> The beans are roasted, developing
                    the characteristic flavour of coffee.
